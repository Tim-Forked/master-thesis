## Contents
The following subsections are the main parts of the work. The first one is about classical reinforcement learning (the Q-learning algorithm). The second one focus on classical supervised Machine Learning using Neural Networks in the context of multilabel calssification. The third part focus ona more recent reinforcement learning algorithm called Policy Gradient, and which by the use of Neural networks scales much better than Q-learning with the classical approach.
